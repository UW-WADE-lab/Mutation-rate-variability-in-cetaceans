  {"id":"bergeron_etal23","abstract":"The germline mutation rate determines the pace of genome evolution and is an evolving parameter itself1. However, little is known about what determines its evolution, as most studies of mutation rates have focused on single species with different methodologies2. Here we quantify germline mutation rates across vertebrates by sequencing and comparing the high-coverage genomes of 151 parent–offspring trios from 68 species of mammals, fishes, birds and reptiles. We show that the per-generation mutation rate varies among species by a factor of 40, with mutation rates being higher for males than for females in mammals and birds, but not in reptiles and fishes. The generation time, age at maturity and species-level fecundity are the key life-history traits affecting this variation among species. Furthermore, species with higher long-term effective population sizes tend to have lower mutation rates per generation, providing support for the drift barrier hypothesis3. The exceptionally high yearly mutation rates of domesticated animals, which have been continually selected on fecundity traits including shorter generation times, further support the importance of generation time in the evolution of mutation rates. Overall, our comparative analysis of pedigree-based mutation rates provides ecological insights on the mutation rate evolution in vertebrates.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Bergeron","given":"Lucie A."},{"family":"Besenbacher","given":"Søren"},{"family":"Zheng","given":"Jiao"},{"family":"Li","given":"Panyi"},{"family":"Bertelsen","given":"Mads Frost"},{"family":"Quintard","given":"Benoit"},{"family":"Hoffman","given":"Joseph I."},{"family":"Li","given":"Zhipeng"},{"family":"St. Leger","given":"Judy"},{"family":"Shao","given":"Changwei"},{"family":"Stiller","given":"Josefin"},{"family":"Gilbert","given":"M.

  {"id":"ellegren_etal03","abstract":"Recent advances in the large-scale sequencing of mammalian genomes have provided a means to study divergence in not only genic sequences but also in the non-coding bulk of DNA. There is evidence of significant variation in the levels of divergence between presumably neutral regions, pointing at an underlying variation in the rate of mutation across the genome. Apparently, such variation occurs on different scales, including sequence context effects (the influence of neighboring nucleotides on the rate of mutation at individual sites), variation within chromosomes (on the scales of kilobases as well as megabases), and between chromosomes (among autosomes as well as between autosomes and sex chromosomes). An important aspect for further research in this area is to study whether there is an ultimate evolutionary explanation for mutation rate variation within mammalian genomes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Ellegren","given":"Hans"},{"family":"Smith","given":"Nick GC"},{"family":"Webster","given":"Matthew T"}],"citation-key":"ellegren_etal03","container-title":"Current Opinion in Genetics & Development","container-title-short":"Current Opinion in Genetics & Development","DOI":"10.1016/j.gde.2003.10.008","ISSN":"0959-437X","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003",12,1]]},"page":"562-568","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Mutation rate variation in the mammalian genome","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959437X03001461","volume":"13"},

  {"id":"nabholz_etal08","abstract":"Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is the most popular marker of molecular diversity in animals, primarily because of its elevated mutation rate. After &gt;20 years of intensive usage, the extent of mitochondrial evolutionary rate variations across species, their practical consequences on sequence analysis methods, and the ultimate reasons for mtDNA hypermutability are still largely unresolved issues. Using an extensive cytochrome b data set, fossil data, and taking advantage of the decoupled dynamics of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions, we measure the lineage-specific mitochondrial mutation rate across 1,696 mammalian species and compare it with the nuclear rate. We report an unexpected 2 orders of magnitude mitochondrial mutation rate variation between lineages: cytochrome b third codon positions are renewed every 1–2 Myr, in average, in the fastest evolving mammals, whereas it takes &gt;100 Myr in slow-evolving lineages. This result has obvious implications in the fields of molecular phylogeny, molecular dating, and population genetics. Variations of mitochondrial substitution rate across species are partly explained by body mass, longevity, and age of female sexual maturity. The classical metabolic rate and generation time hypothesis, however, do not fully explain the observed patterns, especially a stronger effect of longevity in long-lived than in short-lived species. We propose that natural selection tends to decrease the mitochondrial mutation rate in long-lived species, in agreement with the mitochondrial theory of aging.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Nabholz","given":"Benoit"},{"family":"Glémin","given":"Sylvain"},{"family":"Galtier","given":"Nicolas"}],"citation-key":"nabholz_etal08","container-title":"Molecular Biology and Evolution","container-title-short":"Molecular Biology and Evolution","DOI":"10.1093/molbev/msm248","ISSN":"0737-4038","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",1,1]]},"page":"120-130","source":"Silverchair","title":"Strong Variations of Mitochondrial Mutation Rate across Mammals—the Longevity Hypothesis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msm248","volume":"25"},
  {"id":"Nabholz2009a","abstract":"During the last ten years, major advances have been made in characterizing and understanding the evolution of mitochondrial DNA, the most popular marker of molecular biodiversity. Several important results were recently reported using mammals as model organisms, including (i) the absence of relationship between mitochondrial DNA diversity and life-history or ecological variables, (ii) the absence of prominent adaptive selection, contrary to what was found in invertebrates, and (iii) the unexpectedly large variation in neutral substitution rate among lineages, revealing a possible link with species maximal longevity. We propose to challenge these results thanks to the bird/mammal comparison. Direct estimates of population size are available in birds, and this group presents striking life-history trait differences with mammals (higher mass-specific metabolic rate and longevity). These properties make birds the ideal model to directly test for population size effects, and to discriminate between competing hypotheses about the causes of substitution rate variation.RESULTS:A phylogenetic analysis of cytochrome b third-codon position confirms that the mitochondrial DNA mutation rate is quite variable in birds, passerines being the fastest evolving order. On average, mitochondrial DNA evolves slower in birds than in mammals of similar body size. This result is in agreement with the longevity hypothesis, and contradicts the hypothesis of a metabolic rate-dependent mutation rate. Birds show no footprint of adaptive selection on cytochrome b evolutionary patterns, but no link between direct estimates of population size and cytochrome b diversity. The mutation rate is the best predictor we have of within-species mitochondrial diversity in birds. It partly explains the differences in mitochondrial DNA diversity patterns observed between mammals and birds, previously interpreted as reflecting Hill-Robertson interferences with the W chromosome.CONCLUSION:Mitochondrial DNA diversity patterns in birds are strongly influenced by the wide, unexpected variation of mutation rate across species. From a fundamental point of view, these results are strongly consistent with a relationship between species maximal longevity and mitochondrial mutation rate, in agreement with the mitochondrial theory of ageing. Form an applied point of view, this study reinforces and extends the message of caution previously expressed for mammals: mitochondrial data tell nothing about species population sizes, and strongly depart the molecular clock assumption.","author":[{"family":"Nabholz","given":"Benoit"},{"family":"Glémin","given":"Sylvain"},{"family":"Galtier","given":"Nicolas"}],"citation-key":"Nabholz2009a","container-title":"BMC Evolutionary Biology","DOI":"10.1186/1471-2148-9-54","ISBN":"1471-2148","ISSN":"14712148","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009"]]},"page":"1-13","PMID":"19284537","title":"The erratic mitochondrial clock: Variations of mutation rate, not population size, affect mtDNA diversity across birds and mammals","type":"article-journal","volume":"9"},

We estimated μ directly from pedigrees in four baleen whale species for both the mitochondrial control region and nuclear genome. The results suggest values higher than those obtained through phylogeny-based estimates and similar to pedigree-based values for primates and toothed whales. Applying our estimate of μ reduces previous genetic-based estimates of preexploitation whale abundance by 86% and suggests that μ cannot explain low cancer rates in gigantic mammals. Our study shows that it is feasible to estimate μ directly from pedigrees in natural populations, with wide-ranging implications for ecological and evolutionary research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Suárez-Menéndez","given":"Marcos"},{"family":"Bérubé","given":"Martine"},{"family":"Furni","given":"Fabrício"},{"family":"Rivera-León","given":"Vania E."},{"family":"Heide-Jørgensen","given":"Mads-Peter"},{"family":"Larsen","given":"Finn"},{"family":"Sears","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Ramp","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Eriksson","given":"Britas Klemens"},{"family":"Etienne","given":"Rampal S."},{"family":"Robbins","given":"Jooke"},{"family":"Palsbøll","given":"Per J."}],"citation-key":"suarez-menendez_etal23","container-title":"Science","DOI":"10.1126/science.adf2160","issue":"6661","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",9]]},"page":"990-995","publisher":"American Association for the Advancement of Science","source":"science.org (Atypon)","title":"Wild pedigrees inform mutation rates and historic abundance in baleen whales","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adf2160","volume":"381"}
