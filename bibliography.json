  {"id":"bergeron_etal23","abstract":"The germline mutation rate determines the pace of genome evolution and is an evolving parameter itself1. However, little is known about what determines its evolution, as most studies of mutation rates have focused on single species with different methodologies2. Here we quantify germline mutation rates across vertebrates by sequencing and comparing the high-coverage genomes of 151 parent–offspring trios from 68 species of mammals, fishes, birds and reptiles. We show that the per-generation mutation rate varies among species by a factor of 40, with mutation rates being higher for males than for females in mammals and birds, but not in reptiles and fishes. The generation time, age at maturity and species-level fecundity are the key life-history traits affecting this variation among species. Furthermore, species with higher long-term effective population sizes tend to have lower mutation rates per generation, providing support for the drift barrier hypothesis3. The exceptionally high yearly mutation rates of domesticated animals, which have been continually selected on fecundity traits including shorter generation times, further support the importance of generation time in the evolution of mutation rates. Overall, our comparative analysis of pedigree-based mutation rates provides ecological insights on the mutation rate evolution in vertebrates.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Bergeron","given":"Lucie A."},{"family":"Besenbacher","given":"Søren"},{"family":"Zheng","given":"Jiao"},{"family":"Li","given":"Panyi"},{"family":"Bertelsen","given":"Mads Frost"},{"family":"Quintard","given":"Benoit"},{"family":"Hoffman","given":"Joseph I."},{"family":"Li","given":"Zhipeng"},{"family":"St. Leger","given":"Judy"},{"family":"Shao","given":"Changwei"},{"family":"Stiller","given":"Josefin"},{"family":"Gilbert","given":"M.

  {"id":"groot_etal23","abstract":"The identification of patterns in trait evolution is essential to understand the interaction of evolutionary forces, and provides useful information for species management. Cetaceans are a phylogenetically well-resolved infraorder that exhibit distinct trait variation across behavioral, molecular, and life history dimensions, yet few researchers have applied a meta-analytic or comparative approach to these traits. To understand cetacean trait evolution, we used a phylogenetic generalized least squares approach to examine the cognitive buffer hypothesis (CBH). A large brain should buffer individuals against environmental challenges through increasing survival rates, and a longer lifespan should buffer individuals against the cost of extended development for larger brains according to the CBH, leading to an expected positive correlation between brain size and lifespan. In contrast to this expectation, previously observed in taxa including primates, we found a negative correlation between brain size and lifespan in cetaceans. This suggests cetaceans experience selective pressures different from most other mammals in these traits but may be more similar to some social mammalian carnivores that display alloparenting. We also provide a comprehensive dataset to explore additional aspects of trait evolution but which would greatly benefit from studies on behavioral ecology across cetaceans and increased focus on data deficient species.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",10,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Groot","given":"Nikita E"},{"family":"Constantine","given":"Rochelle"},{"family":"Garland","given":"Ellen C"},{"family":"Carroll","given":"Emma L"}],"citation-key":"groot_etal23","container-title":"Evolution","container-title-short":"Evolution","DOI":"10.1093/evolut/qpac050","ISSN":"0014-3820","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,1]]},"page":"534-549","source":"Silverchair","title":"Phylogenetically controlled life history trait meta-analysis in cetaceans reveals unexpected negative brain size and longevity correlation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/evolut/qpac050","volume":"77"},

Genomics tools can provide precise estimates of basic features of wildlife populations, such as effective population size, inbreeding, demographic history and population structure, that are critical for conservation efforts. Moreover, population genomics studies can identify particular genetic loci and variants responsible for inbreeding depression or adaptation to changing environments, allowing for conservation efforts to estimate the capacity of populations to evolve and adapt in response to environmental change and to manage for adaptive variation. While connections from basic research to applied wildlife conservation have been slow to develop, these connections are increasingly strengthening.

  {"id":"Jackson2009","abstract":"Baleen whales are the largest animals that have ever lived. To develop an improved estimation of substitution rate for nuclear and mitochondrial DNA for this taxon, we implemented a relaxed-clock phylogenetic approach using three fossil calibration dates: the divergence between odontocetes and mysticetes similar to 34 million years ago (Ma), between the balaenids and balaenopterids similar to 28 Ma, and the time to most recent common ancestor within the Balaenopteridae similar to 12 Ma. We examined seven mitochondrial genomes, a large number of mitochondrial control region sequences (219 haplotypes for 465 bp) and nine nuclear introns representing five species of whales, within which multiple species-specific alleles were sequenced to account for within-species diversity (1-15 for each locus). The total data set represents >1.65 Mbp of mitogenome and nuclear genomic sequence. The estimated Substitution rate for the humpback whale control region (3.9%/million years, My) was higher than previous estimates for baleen whales but slow relative to other mammal species with similar generation times (e.g., human-chimp mean rate > 20%/My). The mitogenomic third codon position rate was also slow relative to other mammals (mean estimate 1%/My compared with a mammalian average of 9.8%/My for the cytochrome h gene). The mean nuclear genomic substitution rate (0.05%/My) was substantially slower than average synonymous estimate,,, for other mammals (0.21-0.37%/My across a range of studies). The nuclear and mitogenome rate estimates for baleen whales were thus roughly consistent with all 8- to 10-fold slowing due to a combination of large body size and long generation times. Surprisingly, despite the large data set of nuclear intron sequences, there was only weak and conflicting Support for alternate hypotheses about the phylogeny of balaenopterid whales, suggesting that interspecies introgressions or a rapid radiation has obscured species relationships in the nuclear genome.","author":[{"family":"Jackson","given":"J A"},{"family":"Baker","given":"C S"},{"family":"Vant","given":"M"},{"family":"Steel","given":"D J"},{"family":"Medrano-Gonzalez","given":"L"},{"family":"Palumbi","given":"S R"}],"citation-key":"Jackson2009","container-title":"Molecular Biology and Evolution","DOI":"DOI 10.1093/molbev/msp169","ISBN":"0737-4038","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009"]]},"language":"English","page":"2427-2440","title":"Big and Slow: Phylogenetic Estimates of Molecular Evolution in Baleen Whales (Suborder Mysticeti)","type":"article-journal","URL":"<Go to ISI>://000271422300003","volume":"26"},

Our trees extend sampling from the $\\sim 90$ extant species to over 500 living and extinct species, and therefore allow for more robust inference of macroevolutionary dynamics. While the diversification scenarios, we recover are broadly concordant with those inferred from molecular phylogenies they differ in critical ways, notably in the relative contributions of extinction and speciation rate shifts in driving rapid radiations.

Here, we summarize published rate data and show a strong relationship between substitution rate and body size. For instance, rates of nuclear and mtDNA evolution are slow in whales, intermediate in primates, and fast in rodents. A similar relationship exists for poikilothermic vertebrates. However, these taxa have slower mtDNA substitution rates overall than do homeotherms of similar size. A number of physiological and life history variables are highly correlated with body size. Of these, generation time and metabolic rate explain some patterns of rate heterogeneity equally well. In many cases, however, differences in metabolic rate explain important exceptions to the generation time model. Correlation between metabolic rate and nucleotide substitution may be mediated by (i) the mutagenic effects of oxygen radicals that are abundant by-products of aerobic respiration, and (ii) increased rates of DNA synthesis and nucleotide replacement in organisms with higher metabolic rates.

  {"id":"mcgowen_etal20","abstract":"The evolution of cetaceans, from their early transition to an aquatic lifestyle to their subsequent diversification, has been the subject of numerous studies. However, although the higher-level relationships among cetacean families have been largely settled, several aspects of the systematics within these groups remain unresolved. Problematic clades include the oceanic dolphins (37 spp.), which have experienced a recent rapid radiation, and the beaked whales (22 spp.), which have not been investigated in detail using nuclear loci. The combined application of high-throughput sequencing with techniques that target specific genomic sequences provide a powerful means of rapidly generating large volumes of orthologous sequence data for use in phylogenomic studies. To elucidate the phylogenetic relationships within the Cetacea, we combined sequence capture with Illumina sequencing to generate data for $\\sim $3200 protein-coding genes for 68 cetacean species and their close relatives including the pygmy hippopotamus. By combining data from $&gt;$38,000 exons with existing sequences from 11 cetaceans and seven outgroup taxa, we produced the first comprehensive comparative genomic data set for cetaceans, spanning 6,527,596 aligned base pairs (bp) and 89 taxa. Phylogenetic trees reconstructed with maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference of concatenated loci, as well as with coalescence analyses of individual gene trees, produced mostly concordant and well-supported trees. Our results completely resolve the relationships among beaked whales as well as the contentious relationships among oceanic dolphins, especially the problematic subfamily Delphinidae. We carried out Bayesian estimation of species divergence times using MCMCTree and compared our complete data set to a subset of clocklike genes. Analyses using the complete data set consistently showed less variance in divergence times than the reduced data set. In addition, integration of new fossils (e.g., Mystacodon selenensis) indicates that the diversification of Crown Cetacea began before the Late Eocene and the divergence of Crown Delphinidae as early as the Middle Miocene.

The Cetacean Genomes Project (CGP) began in early 2020 to facilitate the generation of near error-free, chromosome-resolved reference genomes for all cetacean species. Towards that goal, and using the methods, goals and genome assembly quality standards of the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP), we generated 13 new reference genomes across eight of the 14 cetacean families. Additionally, we summarize the genome assembly characteristics for 18 species, including these newly-generated and five published genome assemblies that meet the completeness and quality standards. We infer ancestral linkage groups (ALG) for cetaceans, showing that the ancestral karyotype of 22 ALGs is largely conserved in extant species, except for Ziphiidae, and for Balaenidae and Kogiidae, which exhibit similar independent fusions. Gene annotation, characterization of historical demography, heterozygosity and runs of homozygosity (ROH) reveal important information for conservation applications. By comparing the new reference genomes to previous draft assemblies, we show that the reference genomes have enhanced characteristics that will support and promote scientific research. Specifically, the genomes improve resolution and characterization of repetitive elements, provide validation (or exclusion) of genes linked to complex traits, and allow more complete characterization of gene regions such as the highly complex Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) Class I and II gene clusters that are important for population health.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",7,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Morin","given":"Phillip A."},{"family":"Bein","given":"Bernhard"},{"family":"Bortoluzzi","given":"Chiara"},{"family":"Bukhman","given":"Yury V."},{"family":"Hains","given":"Taylor"},{"family":"Heimeier","given":"Dorothea"},{"family":"Uliano-Silva","given":"Marcela"},{"family":"Absolon","given":"Dominic E."},{"family":"Abueg","given":"Linelle"},{"family":"Antosiewicz-Bourget","given":"Jessica"},{"family":"Balacco","given":"Jennifer R."},{"family":"Bonde","given":"Robert K."},{"family":"Brajuka","given":"Nadolina"},{"family":"Brownlow","given":"Andrew C."},{"family":"Carroll","given":"Emma L."},{"family":"Carter","given":"Molly"},{"family":"Collins","given":"Joanna"},{"family":"Davison","given":"Nicholas J."},{"family":"Denton","given":"Amy"},{"family":"Fedrigo","given":"Olivier"},{"family":"Foote","given":"Andrew D."},{"family":"Formenti","given":"Giulio"},{"family":"Gallo","given":"Guido R."},{"family":"Greve","given":"Carola"},{"family":"Houck","given":"Marlys L."},{"family":"Howard","given":"Caroline"},{"family":"Jacobsen","given":"Jeff K."},{"family":"Jain","given":"Nivesh"},{"family":"Krasheninnikova","given":"Ksenia"},{"family":"Maloney","given":"Brigid M."},{"family":"Manley","given":"Bethan F."},{"family":"Mathers","given":"Thomas C."},{"family":"Mccarthy","given":"Shane A."},{"family":"Mcgowen","given":"Michael R."},{"family":"Meyer","given":"Susanne"},{"family":"Mountcastle","given":"Jacquelyn"},{"family":"Neely","given":"Benjamin A."},{"family":"O’toole","given":"Brian"},{"family":"Pelan","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Rosel","given":"Patricia E."},{"family":"Rowles","given":"Teri K."},{"family":"Ryder","given":"Oliver A."},{"family":"Schell","given":"Tilman"},{"family":"Sims","given":"Ying"},{"family":"St Leger","given":"Judy"},{"family":"Stewart","given":"Ron"},{"family":"Ternes","given":"Kerstin"},{"family":"Tilley","given":"Tatiana"},{"family":"Whelan","given":"Conor"},{"family":"Wood","given":"Jonathan M.

  {"id":"Nabholz2009a","abstract":"During the last ten years, major advances have been made in characterizing and understanding the evolution of mitochondrial DNA, the most popular marker of molecular biodiversity. Several important results were recently reported using mammals as model organisms, including (i) the absence of relationship between mitochondrial DNA diversity and life-history or ecological variables, (ii) the absence of prominent adaptive selection, contrary to what was found in invertebrates, and (iii) the unexpectedly large variation in neutral substitution rate among lineages, revealing a possible link with species maximal longevity. We propose to challenge these results thanks to the bird/mammal comparison. Direct estimates of population size are available in birds, and this group presents striking life-history trait differences with mammals (higher mass-specific metabolic rate and longevity). These properties make birds the ideal model to directly test for population size effects, and to discriminate between competing hypotheses about the causes of substitution rate variation.RESULTS:A phylogenetic analysis of cytochrome b third-codon position confirms that the mitochondrial DNA mutation rate is quite variable in birds, passerines being the fastest evolving order. On average, mitochondrial DNA evolves slower in birds than in mammals of similar body size. This result is in agreement with the longevity hypothesis, and contradicts the hypothesis of a metabolic rate-dependent mutation rate. Birds show no footprint of adaptive selection on cytochrome b evolutionary patterns, but no link between direct estimates of population size and cytochrome b diversity. The mutation rate is the best predictor we have of within-species mitochondrial diversity in birds. It partly explains the differences in mitochondrial DNA diversity patterns observed between mammals and birds, previously interpreted as reflecting Hill-Robertson interferences with the W chromosome.CONCLUSION:Mitochondrial DNA diversity patterns in birds are strongly influenced by the wide, unexpected variation of mutation rate across species. From a fundamental point of view, these results are strongly consistent with a relationship between species maximal longevity and mitochondrial mutation rate, in agreement with the mitochondrial theory of ageing. Form an applied point of view, this study reinforces and extends the message of caution previously expressed for mammals: mitochondrial data tell nothing about species population sizes, and strongly depart the molecular clock assumption.","author":[{"family":"Nabholz","given":"Benoit"},{"family":"Glémin","given":"Sylvain"},{"family":"Galtier","given":"Nicolas"}],"citation-key":"Nabholz2009a","container-title":"BMC Evolutionary Biology","DOI":"10.1186/1471-2148-9-54","ISBN":"1471-2148","ISSN":"14712148","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009"]]},"page":"1-13","PMID":"19284537","title":"The erratic mitochondrial clock: Variations of mutation rate, not population size, affect mtDNA diversity across birds and mammals","type":"article-journal","volume":"9"},
  {"id":"nachman_crowell00","abstract":"Many previous estimates of the mutation rate in humans have relied on screens of visible mutants. We investigated the rate and pattern of mutations at the nucleotide level by comparing pseudogenes in humans and chimpanzees to (i) provide an estimate of the average mutation rate per nucleotide, (ii) assess heterogeneity of mutation rate at different sites and for different types of mutations, (iii) test the hypothesis that the X chromosome has a lower mutation rate than autosomes, and (iv) estimate the deleterious mutation rate. Eighteen processed pseudogenes were sequenced, including 12 on autosomes and 6 on the X chromosome. The average mutation rate was estimated to be ~2.5 × 10−8 mutations per nucleotide site or 175 mutations per diploid genome per generation. Rates of mutation for both transitions and transversions at CpG dinucleotides are one order of magnitude higher than mutation rates at other sites. Single nucleotide substitutions are 10 times more frequent than length mutations. Comparison of rates of evolution for X-linked and autosomal pseudogenes suggests that the male mutation rate is 4 times the female mutation rate, but provides no evidence for a reduction in mutation rate that is specific to the X chromosome. Using conservative calculations of the proportion of the genome subject to purifying selection, we estimate that the genomic deleterious mutation rate (U) is at least 3. This high rate is difficult to reconcile with multiplicative fitness effects of individual mutations and suggests that synergistic epistasis among harmful mutations may be common.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",10,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Nachman","given":"Michael W"},{"family":"Crowell","given":"Susan L"}],"citation-key":"nachman_crowell00","container-title":"Genetics","container-title-short":"Genetics","DOI":"10.1093/genetics/156.1.297","ISSN":"1943-2631","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2000",9,1]]},"page":"297-304","source":"Silverchair","title":"Estimate of the Mutation Rate per Nucleotide in Humans","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/genetics/156.1.297","volume":"156"},
  {"id":"pereira_baker06","abstract":"Current understanding of the diversification of birds is hindered by their incomplete fossil record and uncertainty in phylogenetic relationships and phylogenetic rates of molecular evolution. Here we performed the first comprehensive analysis of mitogenomic data of 48 vertebrates, including 35 birds, to derive a Bayesian timescale for avian evolution and to estimate rates of DNA evolution. Our approach used multiple fossil time constraints scattered throughout the phylogenetic tree and accounts for uncertainties in time constraints, branch lengths, and heterogeneity of rates of DNA evolution. We estimated that the major vertebrate lineages originated in the Permian; the 95% credible intervals of our estimated ages of the origin of archosaurs (258 MYA), the amniote-amphibian split (356 MYA), and the archosaur-lizard divergence (278 MYA) bracket estimates from the fossil record. The origin of modern orders of birds was estimated to have occurred throughout the Cretaceous beginning about 139 MYA, arguing against a cataclysmic extinction of lineages at the Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary. We identified fossils that are useful as time constraints within vertebrates. Our timescale reveals that rates of molecular evolution vary across genes and among taxa through time, thereby refuting the widely used mitogenomic or cytochrome b molecular clock in birds. Moreover, the 5-Myr divergence time assumed between 2 genera of geese (Branta and Anser) to originally calibrate the standard mitochondrial clock rate of 0.01 substitutions per site per lineage per Myr (s/s/l/Myr) in birds was shown to be underestimated by about 9.5 Myr. Phylogenetic rates in birds vary between 0.0009 and 0.012 s/s/l/Myr, indicating that many phylogenetic splits among avian taxa also have been underestimated and need to be revised. We found no support for the hypothesis that the molecular clock in birds \"ticks\" according to a constant rate of substitution per unit of mass-specific metabolic energy rather than per unit of time, as recently suggested. Our analysis advances knowledge of rates of DNA evolution across birds and other vertebrates and will, therefore, aid comparative biology studies that seek to infer the origin and timing of major adaptive shifts in vertebrates.","author":[{"family":"Pereira","given":"Sergio L."},{"family":"Baker","given":"Allan J."}],"citation-key":"pereira_baker06","container-title":"Molecular Biology and Evolution","container-title-short":"Mol Biol Evol","DOI":"10.1093/molbev/msl038","ISSN":"0737-4038","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006",9]]},"language":"eng","page":"1731-1740","PMID":"16774978","source":"PubMed","title":"A mitogenomic timescale for birds detects variable phylogenetic rates of molecular evolution and refutes the standard molecular clock","type":"article-journal","volume":"23"},

Herbs show much higher rates of molecular change but also much higher variance in rates.

Evidence is growing that at least some of this variation is associated with species characteristics, such as body size, diversification rate, or population size. One of the strongest correlates of the rate of molecular evolution in vertebrates is generation time (GT): Species with faster generation turnover tend to have higher rates of molecular evolution, presumably because their genomes are copied more frequently and therefore collect more DNA replication errors per unit time. But the GT effect has never been tested for nonvertebrate animals. Here, we present the first general test of the GT effect in invertebrates, using 15 genes from 143 species spread across the major eumetazoan superphyla (including arthropods, nematodes, molluscs, annelids, platyhelminthes, cnidarians, echinoderms, and urochordates). We find significant evidence that rates of molecular evolution are correlated with GT in invertebrates and that this effect applies consistently across genes and taxonomic groups. Furthermore, the GT effect is evident in nonsynonymous substitutions, whereas theory predicts (and most previous evidence has supported) a relationship only in synonymous changes. We discuss both the practical and theoretical implications of these findings.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",7,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Thomas","given":"Jessica A."},{"family":"Welch","given":"John J."},{"family":"Lanfear","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Bromham","given":"Lindell"}],"citation-key":"thomas_etal10","container-title":"Molecular Biology and Evolution","container-title-short":"Molecular Biology and Evolution","DOI":"10.1093/molbev/msq009","ISSN":"0737-4038","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",5,1]]},"page":"1173-1180","source":"Silverchair","title":"A Generation Time Effect on the Rate of Molecular Evolution in Invertebrates","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msq009","volume":"27"},
  {"id":"zeng_etal19","abstract":"It is known that the effective population size (Ne) and the mutation rate (u) vary across the genome. Here, we show that ignoring this heterogeneity may lead to biased estimates of past demography. To solve the problem, we develop new methods for jointly inferring past changes in population size and detecting variation in Ne and u between loci. These methods rely on either polymorphism data alone or both polymorphism and divergence data. In addition to inferring demography, we can use the methods to study a variety of questions: 1) comparing sex chromosomes with autosomes (for finding evidence for male-driven evolution, an unequal sex ratio, or sex-biased demographic changes) and 2) analyzing multilocus data from within autosomes or sex chromosomes (for studying determinants of variability in Ne and u). Simulations suggest that the methods can provide accurate parameter estimates and have substantial statistical power for detecting difference in Ne and u. As an example, we use the methods to analyze a polymorphism data set from Drosophila simulans. We find clear evidence for rapid population expansion. The results also indicate that the autosomes have a higher mutation rate than the X chromosome and that the sex ratio is probably female-biased. The new methods have been implemented in a user-friendly package.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",7,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Zeng","given":"Kai"},{"family":"Jackson","given":"Benjamin C"},{"family":"Barton","given":"Henry J"}],"citation-key":"zeng_etal19","container-title":"Molecular Biology and Evolution","container-title-short":"Molecular Biology and Evolution","DOI":"10.1093/molbev/msy212","ISSN":"0737-4038","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",2,1]]},"page":"423-433","source":"Silverchair","title":"Methods for Estimating Demography and Detecting Between-Locus Differences in the Effective Population Size and Mutation Rate","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msy212","volume":"36"},
  {"id":"Zhang2014a","abstract":"Birds are the most species-rich class of tetrapod vertebrates and have wide relevance across many research fields. We explored bird macroevolution using full genomes from 48 avian species representing all major extant clades. The avian genome is principally characterized by its constrained size, which predominantly arose because of lineage-specific erosion of repetitive elements, large segmental deletions, and gene loss. Avian genomes furthermore show a remarkably high degree of evolutionary stasis at the levels of nucleotide sequence, gene synteny, and chromosomal structure. Despite this pattern of conservation, we detected many non-neutral evolutionary changes in protein-coding genes and noncoding regions. These analyses reveal that pan-avian genomic diversity covaries with adaptations to different lifestyles and convergent evolution of traits.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",11,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Guojie"},{"family":"Li","given":"Cai"},{"family":"Li","given":"Qiye"},{"family":"Li","given":"Bo"},{"family":"Larkin","given":"Denis M"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Chul"},{"family":"Storz","given":"Jay F"},{"family":"Antunes","given":"Agostinho"},{"family":"Greenwold","given":"Matthew J"},{"family":"Meredith","given":"Robert W"},{"family":"Ödeen","given":"Anders"},{"family":"Cui","given":"Jie"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Qi"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Luohao"},{"family":"Pan","given":"Hailin"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Zongji"},{"family":"Jin","given":"Lijun"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Pei"},{"family":"Hu","given":"Haofu"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Hu","given":"Jiang"},{"family":"Xiao","given":"Jin"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Zhikai"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Yang"},{"family":"Xie","given":"Qiaolin"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Hao"},{"family":"Lian","given":"Jinmin"},{"family":"Wen","given":"Ping"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Fang"},{"family":"Li","given":"Hui"},{"family":"Zeng","given":"Yongli"},{"family":"Xiong","given":"Zijun"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Shiping"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Long"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Zhiyong"},{"family":"An","given":"Na"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Jie"},{"family":"Zheng","given":"Qiumei"},{"family":"Xiong","given":"Yingqi"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Guangbiao"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Bo"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Jingjing"},{"family":"Fan","given":"Yu"},{"family":"Fonseca","given":"Rute R","non-dropping-particle":"da"},{"family":"Alfaro-Núñez","given":"Alonzo"},{"family":"Schubert","given":"Mikkel"},{"family":"Orlando","given":"Ludovic"},{"family":"Mourier","given":"Tobias"},{"family":"Howard","given":"Jason T"},{"family":"Ganapathy","given":"Ganeshkumar"},{"family":"Pfenning","given":"Andreas"},{"family":"Whitney","given":"Osceola"},{"family":"Rivas","given":"Miriam V"},{"family":"Hara","given":"Erina"},{"family":"Smith","given":"Julia"},{"family":"Farré","given":"Marta"},{"family":"Narayan","given":"Jitendra"},{"family":"Slavov","given":"Gancho"},{"family":"Romanov","given":"Michael N"},{"family":"Borges","given":"Rui"},{"family":"Machado","given":"João Paulo"},{"family":"Khan","given":"Imran"},{"family":"Springer","given":"Mark S"},{"family":"Gatesy","given":"John"},{"family":"Hoffmann","given":"Federico G"},{"family":"Opazo","given":"Juan C"},{"family":"Håstad","given":"Olle"},{"family":"Sawyer","given":"Roger H"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Heebal"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Kyu-Won"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Hyeon Jeong"},{"family":"Cho","given":"Seoae"},{"family":"Li","given":"Ning"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Yinhua"},{"family":"Bruford","given":"Michael W"},{"family":"Zhan","given":"Xiangjiang"},{"family":"Dixon","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Bertelsen","given":"Mads F"},{"family":"Derryberry","given":"Elizabeth"},{"family":"Warren","given":"Wesley"},{"family":"Wilson","given":"Richard K"},{"family":"Li","given":"Shengbin"},{"family":"Ray","given":"David A"},{"family":"Green","given":"Richard E"},{"family":"O'Brien","given":"Stephen J"},{"family":"Griffin","given":"Darren"},{"family":"Johnson","given":"Warren E"},{"family":"Haussler","given":"David"},{"family":"Ryder","given":"Oliver A"},{"family":"Willerslev","given":"Eske"},{"family":"Graves","given":"Gary R"},{"family":"Alström","given":"Per"},{"family":"Fjeldså","given":"Jon"},{"family":"Mindell","given":"David P"},{"family":"Edwards","given":"Scott V"},{"family":"Braun","given":"Edward L"},{"family":"Rahbek","given":"Carsten"},{"family":"Burt","given":"David W"},{"family":"Houde","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yong"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Huanming"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Jian"},{"family":"Avian Genome Consortium","given":"Avian Genome"},{"family":"Jarvis","given":"Erich D"},{"family":"Gilbert","given":"M Thomas P"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Jun"}],"citation-key":"Zhang2014a","container-title":"Science (New York, N.Y.)","DOI":"10.1126/science.1251385","ISSN":"1095-9203","issue":"6215","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",12,12]]},"page":"1311-20","PMID":"25504712","publisher":"American Association for the Advancement of Science","title":"Comparative genomics reveals insights into avian genome evolution and adaptation.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25504712","volume":"346"}
