# Mutation-rate-variability-in-cetaceans
This repo contains bash scripts and R code used to process cetacean genomes, calculate genomic mutation rate, and generate the manuscript titled, "Mutation rate variability in cetacean genomes." A living version of this manuscript can be found [here](https://uw-wade-lab.github.io/Mutation-rate-variability-in-cetaceans/).
